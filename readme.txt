This plugin integrates the live chat from giosg.com.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a script tag that will enable the live chat from [www.giosg.com](http://www.giosg.com).

The only thing that needs to be done is to add your giosg company ID under the settings page.

== Basket ==

The giosg basket can be integrated by turning on `Enable basket` from the settings page.
In giosg the currency for the basket needs to be configured to match the default currency for your
wordpress cart. At this point only **woocommerce** is supported.
